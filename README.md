## Explanations

### Github Search enchanced!

The three aliases

* `ghspr` ([gh]ithub [s]earch [p]ull [r]equest)
* `ghsi` ([gh]ithub [s]earch [i]ssue)
* `ghsr` ([gh]ithub [s]earch [r]epository)

are equal to the default search subcommands provided by the `gh` command, but combines them with fuzzy searching with `fzf`.

### Fine-tuned defaults for PRs!

* `ghpr` Search for open pull requests created by the current user.
* `ghpra` Search for open pull requests assigned to the current user.
* `ghprm` Search for open pull requests with mentions of the current user.
* `ghrr` Search for open pull requests with review requests wanted from the current user.

### Fine-tuned defaults for issues!

* `ghi` Search for open issues created by the current user.
* `ghia` Search for open issues assigned to the current user.
* `ghim` Search for open issues with mentions of the current user.

## Some handy examples

Fuzzy search open PRs which requested a review from you, approve.

```bash
 ghspr --sort=updated --limit 100 --review-requested=@me --archived=false --state=open | xargs -I{} sh -c 'gh pr review --approve {}'
```

Fuzzy search open PRs which requested a review from you, approve and merge.

```bash
 ghspr --sort=updated --limit 100 --review-requested=@me --archived=false --state=open | xargs -I{} sh -c 'gh pr review --approve {} && gh pr merge --squash {}'
```

## Flags

Supports all options that `gh search repos/issues/prs` supports, except for `--json` and `--template` which are being utilized by this extension.
